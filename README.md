## Installation
Clone this repository and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Eli-the-creator/npm-library-template.git
```

---

## Usage
Modify the `src/index.js` or `src/index.ts` file with your custom package logic. Export your modules as needed.

Example:
```js
// src/index.js
export function helloWorld() {
  return "Hello, NPM!";
}
```
Then, import and use it in another project:
```js
import { helloWorld } from 'your-package-name';
console.log(helloWorld()); // "Hello, NPM!"
```

---

## Scripts
Run the following commands:
- `npm run build` â€“ Build the package
- `npm test` â€“ Run tests with Jest
- `npm publish` â€“ Publish to NPM (ensure you're logged in)
- `npm version patch` â€“ Update version (use `minor` or `major` as needed)

---

## Publishing to NPM
1. Ensure you have an NPM account (`npm login`).
2. Run `npm publish` to deploy your package.

For scoped packages (`@username/package-name`), use:
```sh
npm publish --access public
```
